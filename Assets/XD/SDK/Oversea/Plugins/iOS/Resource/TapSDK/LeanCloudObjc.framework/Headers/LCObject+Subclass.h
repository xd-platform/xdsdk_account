 <h3>Subclassing Notes</h3>
 
 Developers can subclass LCObject for a more native object-oriented class structure. Strongly-typed subclasses of LCObject must conform to the LCSubclassing protocol and must call registerSubclass to be returned by LCQuery and other LCObject factories. All methods in LCSubclassing except for [LCSubclassing parseClassName] are already implemented in the LCObject(Subclass) category. Inculding LCObject+Subclass.h in your implementation file provides these implementations automatically.
 
 Subclasses support simpler initializers, query syntax, and dynamic synthesizers.

/*!
 Creates an instance of the registered subclass with this class's parseClassName.
 This helps a subclass ensure that it can be subclassed itself. For example, [LCUser object] will
 return a MyUser object if MyUser is a registered subclass of LCUser. For this reason, [MyClass object] is
 preferred to [[MyClass alloc] init].
 This method can only be called on subclasses which conform to LCSubclassing.
 A default implementation is provided by LCObject which should always be sufficient.

 Registers an Objective-C class for LeanCloud to use for representing a given LeanCloud class.

 name matching [self parseClassName] will be an instance of subclass.
