 If a subclass of LCObject conforms to LCSubclassing and calls registerSubclass, LeanCloud will be able to use that class as the native class for a LeanCloud object.

 Classes conforming to this protocol should subclass LCObject and include LCObject+Subclass.h in their implementation file. This ensures the methods in the Subclass category of LCObject are exposed in its subclasses only.
